Disintegration
==============

An interactive toy that uses the Kinect to track the players body and transform them into a grid of circles.  After a time, the circles transform into physics objects and the players body appears to fall apart under gravity.  

Made at [Tiree Tech Wave](http://tireetechwave.org/) with help from [Adam van Sertima](http://tag.hexagram.ca/people/adam-van-sertima/) from [TAG](http://tag.hexagram.ca/).  Built using [Processing](http://www.processing.org) and [Open Kinect](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Main_Page).  Makes use of [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/)'s [Open Kinect](http://shiffman.net/p5/kinect/) and [Box2d](https://github.com/shiffman/Box2D-for-Processing) bindings for Processing.

There is a [video of the project](https://vimeo.com/110350416) on Vimeo.
